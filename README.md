PuppysPen
=========

A visual math game for 4th graders written in Python for the XO laptop.

[Wiki for the project available on wiki.sugarlabs.org](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Puppy%27s_Pen)


###Description 
Puppy's Pen is an educational game targeted towards 4th grade students interested in learning how to calculate basic perimeter and area. The game consists of procedurally-generated area and perimeter puzzles which can be solved by drawing rectangles on a grid of increasing size. Each puzzle represents a situation in which the owner of a puppy has to satisfy a requirement so that his/her puppy is happy in its pen.


### Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Pygame
- Gtk

How to Run
=========

Puppy's Pen can be played as a standalone Pygame app.

### Running as Pygame App

This game can be played as a desktop application, but only on a machine with Gtk (we recommend using Linux). As long as Python, Pygame, and Gtk are installed, simply run PuppysPen.py to play and test. This does not create a Sugar Activity build, but it will still run on an XO the same way.

Features
==========
- Main menu
- Option to return to main menu, then resume game
- Procedurally-generated, non-repeating levels
- Area puzzles
- Perimeter puzzles
- Combined area and perimeter puzzles
- More difficult puzzles caused by increasing grid size
- Click-and-drag rectangle drawing
- Two-click rectangle drawing
- Positive and negative feedback on user-drawn rectangles


To Do
==========
- Create and add art assets
- Get running on the XO Laptop as Activity
- Make drawing more efficient with blit
- Let the user choose difficulty
- Add effects i.e. mouse hover/click, sounds
- Add animation for successful pen
- Add support for different pen criteria
- Rename Project
- Tutorial Level

- File Explanations
