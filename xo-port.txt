## Observations:

sugar-emulator is now sugar-runnner
To get our app to show up in the virtual XO we need to run:

python setup.py dev

To use sugar-runner we just need to give it some reslolution:

sugar-runner --resolution 800x600

The `exec` field in the activity/activity.info file is the starting point of the application.

Right now I have it set to run TestActivity.TestActivity

In which there is a line to either instatiate TestGame or PuppysPen

TestGame works fine PuppysPen doesn't start.

Looking at the Logs activity at first it was yelling at me about fonts not being intitialized, so I commented all that out.

Then it said the surface wasn't initialized.

So what it seems like to me is that our main() method isn't getting called to initialize pygame.

What I don't understand is how it seems to work in TestGame even though our structure is almost identical.

...so that's where I left off.
